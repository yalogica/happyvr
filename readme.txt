🚀 Create stunning, high-performance 360 virtual tours in minutes. The only React-powered, conflict-free Virtual Tour Builder for WordPress.

== DESCRIPTION ==

HappyVR is the next-generation solution for creating stunning virtual tours and showcasing 360 panoramas on your WordPress website. Whether you are a real estate agent, a museum curator, or a business owner, HappyVR empowers you to let visitors "step inside" your world. Create immersive virtual tours for Real Estate, Showrooms, Museums, and Hotels with HappyVR. While other plugins rely on outdated technology that slows down your site, HappyVR is built on a modern stack (React + Shadow DOM), guaranteeing blazing speed and zero conflicts with your theme.

Give your visitors a "Street View" experience inside your property. Let them walk through rooms, interact with hotspots, and explore every detail in high resolution thanks to our advanced Tile Generation support - available even in the Free version!

> Turn passive visitors into active leads. Give them control to explore, interact, and engage with your space 24/7.


###✨ HOW HAPPYVR PLUGIN CAN HELP YOU

Most virtual tour plugins were built years ago using heavy scripts (jQuery) that often break when you change your theme. HappyVR is different:
⚡ Instant React Editor: Drag & drop hotspots, link scenes, and save changes instantly. No page reloads. No waiting.
🛡️ Shadow DOM Architecture: We use "Shadow DOM" to strictly isolate the viewer's code. This means your theme's CSS will never break your tour, and our tour will never break your site's layout. It is the most stable solution on the market.
💎 Native Tile Support (High Quality): We slice your massive panoramas into small "tiles" (like Google Maps). This allows you to display gigapixel images that load instantly on mobile phones without crashing the browser.
